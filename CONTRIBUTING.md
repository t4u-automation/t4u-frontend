## üìù Code Style

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Avoid `any` types when possible
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props

### File Structure

```
components/     # Reusable React components
app/           # Next.js app router pages
lib/           # Utility functions and API calls
hooks/         # Custom React hooks
contexts/      # React context providers
types/         # TypeScript type definitions
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: PascalCase for components (`MyComponent.tsx`), camelCase for utilities (`myUtil.ts`)
- **Components**: PascalCase (`MyComponent`)
- **Functions**: camelCase (`handleClick`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_RETRIES`)
- **Types/Interfaces**: PascalCase (`UserData`)

## üß™ Testing

Currently, we're working on expanding our test coverage. When adding new features:

1. Manually test all user flows
2. Test on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
3. Test responsive design on mobile devices
4. Check console for errors or warnings

## üé® UI/UX Guidelines

- Follow the existing design patterns
- Use Tailwind CSS classes
- Respect CSS custom properties (variables)
- Ensure accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Test on different screen sizes

## üì¶ Dependencies

- Keep dependencies up to date
- Use exact versions in `package.json` when possible
- Document why new dependencies are needed
- Prefer lightweight libraries

## üîí Security

- Never commit API keys, secrets, or credentials
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Follow Firebase security best practices
- Report security issues privately to the maintainers

## üìö Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Update T4U_ARCHITECTURE.md for architectural changes
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Include examples in documentation

## üöÄ Release Process

1. Version bump in `package.json`
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create a new release tag
4. Deploy to production

## üí¨ Communication

- Be respectful and constructive
- Ask questions if you're unsure
- Help others in discussions
- Celebrate contributions
